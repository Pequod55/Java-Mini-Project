Smart Socket Wrench, It's a digital Torque Socket Wrench which can automatically go through tires and Lugnuts as you Torque them down to spec.
Dynamically add as many new vehicles as required with all the properties except varying number of lugnuts per tire.
Does not have try catches for all inputs because that would make the line count much higher than it is.
Still being commented.
Things that I will work on after finishing basic functions:
1. Adding try catches to all input fields
2. Having a Screen interface (such as gui) instead of command line
3. Xml for saving vehicles instead of arraylists, since they are volatile as of now
4. Actual sensors
